  // My goals in GitHub:
    // Learn the basics and build familiarity and confidence in GitHub
    // Create and develop 2 separate projects with these goals in mind:
        // Return real value to users with each project (Reading tutoring website; Astrological notification app/website)
        // Practice and utilize my growing skills and understanding of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more
        // Build a portfolio of work with verifiable work history for potential employers to access
        // Practice coding in teams to develop real world skills and competencies
    // Have fun nerding out :-)
