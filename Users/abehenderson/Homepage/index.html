		<div>Hi, my name is</div>

		<h1 class="semi-bright">I build things for the web.</h1>
		<p>
			I'm a software engineer specializing in building (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital experiences.  Currently, I'm focused on building accessible, human centered products at <a href="https://codesmith.io/">Codesmith</a>.

	<p>
		Hello!  My name is Abe and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet.  My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I was working as a machinist and our CNC programmer quit.  While the company searched for a replacement, I studied the machine manuals and learned how to program.  Over the following months, I was able to move into the role of programmer and build efficiencies that resulted in higher output and lower scrap rates.<br>
		<br>
		Fast-forward to today, and I've transitioned to applying my love for logic and language to the web.  I've done XYZ cool things, and ZYX things.  My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at <a href="codesmith.io">Codesmith</a> for a variety of clients.<br>
		<br>
		I also recently joined an open-source project where I have taken an active leadership/design role.<br>
		<br>
		Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li><br>
			<li>React</li><br>
			<li>Node.js</li><br>
			<li>Typescript</li><br>
			<li>Redux</li><br>
			<li>Express</li><br>
		</ul>
