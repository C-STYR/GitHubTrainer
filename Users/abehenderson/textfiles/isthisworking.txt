On Thursday, Nov 3rd, I factory reset the Macbook Pro, C02V5BJDHV27
    Unfortunately the homeschool coop, Denali Peak, is still the remote administrator for this laptop.  I put in a request to have that removed but haven't heard back yet.
Upon startup I installed the newest Mac OS, Ventura 13.0 and created the account `abehenderson`
    Next I installed Homebrew.  
        Using Homebrew I installed Git and VS Code
In VS Code:
    In the terminal I selected bash as the default profile
    I cloned the repository `C-STYR/GitHubTrainer` to Documents/LearningJavascript
    I opened the folder `LearningJavascript`
    Using the terminal I created the text file `Users/abehenderson/textfiles/isthisworking.txt`
    Using the terminal I opened `isthisworking.txt` and wrote this text
Now to see if I missed anything or screwed anything up, I'll commit this file, create a mirror branch on C-STYR/GitHubTrainer, push it to the mirror branch, and then create a pull request to merge with origin
