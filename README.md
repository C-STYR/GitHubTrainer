# GitHubTrainer
A repo designed to train skills in git and GitHub free of adverse consequences.


## How to use this repo
Let's start from the very beginning. 

What is git? Git is open source software that allows you to track different versions of a codebase. For example, every time you make a change and save it (which is called "committing" in git-speak), the state of the codebase is preserved. This allows you to go back to previous versions (and to go forward to). Git is very complex but the core functionality is to track changes. That's all you need to know!

If you're starting from scratch, the first thing to do is [install git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) on your computer. 

To use this repo, you can either use GitHub's web interface (or GUI - guided user interface), or the command line. 

What's the command line? It's a way for you to interact directly with your computer by typing a series of commands the computer can understand. There are various ways to do this on various operating systems, but in keeping with the times we'll focus on MacOS and Linux machines' Terminal. 

Open the Terminal on your machine (you'll have to figure this out on your own). You'll see a prompt in which you can write commands, and this is where we are going to write commands to interact with git and GitHub.

So what's GitHub? It's a free (mostly) service that allows you to store your code in online "repositories", which mirror the repositories of code on your own computer. GitHub allows collaboration between different users and often acts as the main source of code for a website. For example, many commercial websites' codebases are stored, modified and shared on GitHub and are then distributed to a hosting service to be delivered out into the world. 

You will have to have a GitHub (hereafter GH) account to use this trainer, so please make one [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account). You don't need any sort of paid account, a free personal account is fine.
