# Using the command line

If you're here, you've elected to learn how to use git and GitHub on the command line. Good choice! This will help develop your understanding of some basic concepts that can only serve you in good stead as the world becomes more and more technologically focused.

Assuming you've already installed `git` on your machine, the next thing to do is clone this repo (short for repository). What's that mean? 

Cloning a repo means copying the online version (which in this case is our "single source of truth", or the standard we all agree to) of this repo to your machine, which we refer to as your "local".

To clone the repo find the button on the upper right hand side of the screen that says `Code` and click it.
