# Algorithms

## How to use this directory

Learning algorithms is an essential part of data manipulation (which is all coding is, probably). Here's a good chance to have a little fun while learning git/GH too. 

1. Select a file within this directory. The file will contain an algorithmic challenge.  Pick any one you like. 

2. Within your own directory in `Users`, create another directory called `algos`.

3. Within `algos`, create a copy of the algorithmic challenge file you liked. For example, if `DataScraping.js` caught your eye, create a copy of that file and place it in your `algos` folder. 

4. Solve the challenge in the COPIED file, not the original, then `add` and `commit` your code. If you're not sure of the mechanics of checking your code, see below.

5. Create a pull request with your new files/directories.


## How to check your code

If you're using VS Code, there's a very useful extension called `Code Runner`; click on the Extensions icon in the left hand sidebar (the one that looks like tetris blocks) and search for `Code Runner` and install. 

1. Once you've got `Code Runner` installed, with the file in question opened, simply run the code using the correct keyboard shortcut for your operating system. I'll leave you to figure that out for yourself (hint: Code => Preferences => Keyboard Shortcuts on mac, or just ctrl + alt + n on windows)

2. You should see an output screen open up beneath your code. If you're lucky, you'll see your return value displayed.
